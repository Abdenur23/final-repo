        <p class="mb-6">
            This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which <strong>Golden Gate Blooms LLC</strong> (referred to herein as "the Company," "we," "us," or "our"), a California-based limited liability company, collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the <strong>www.theweer.com</strong> website ("the Site") and any associated mobile applications or digital services (collectively, "<strong>Our Services</strong>").
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
            By accessing or using Our Services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use Our Services.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data Controllers, Transfers, and Third-Party Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We share personal information with third-party vendors and service providers who assist us in operating Our Services and fulfilling orders. These entities are contractually obligated to use your information only as "Service Providers" for the specific purposes we direct and are prohibited from using your personal information for their own independent purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legal bases for our processing of your personal information are primarily:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>(a) the performance of our contract with you (e.g., order fulfillment);</li>
            <li>(b) your consent (e.g., for marketing communications);</li>
            <li>(c) compliance with legal obligations (e.g., tax record-keeping); and</li>
            <li>(d) our legitimate interests (e.g., website security and analytics), which we balance against your privacy rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Controllership and Accountability</h3>
        <p>
            The Company is the primary <strong>Data Controller</strong> responsible for the processing of all Personal Information collected through Our Services. We are responsible for establishing and maintaining the practices and standards outlined in this Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Flexibility for Business Growth and Restructuring</h3>
        <p>
            In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale, restructuring, transfer of assets, or similar corporate change (collectively, a "<strong>Business Transaction</strong>"), User information, including Personal Information, may be disclosed or transferred to the successor entity. We will ensure that the recipient agrees to adhere to the material terms of this Privacy Policy, or will notify you of any material changes to the Policy necessitated by the Business Transaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Joint Controller Relationships</h3>
        <p>
            We may, from time to time, enter into arrangements with strategic partners (e.g., specific advertising platforms or payment processors) that may result in a joint controller relationship for certain specific, defined processing activities. In such cases, we will maintain transparency regarding our respective responsibilities, which will be accessible upon request.
        </p>

        <h3>Disclaimer for Third-Party Misuse</h3>
        <p>
            Our Services may link to third-party websites, products, or services. We disclaim any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices, content, or actions of any third party. Once you leave Our Services, this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect, and we strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site you visit.

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy (Minors Policy)</h2>
        <p>
            Protecting the privacy of minors is paramount, especially when dealing with personal images.
        </p>

        <h3>Prohibition for Users Under 13</h3>
        <p>
            Our Services are not directed to children under the age of <strong>thirteen (13)</strong>.

        </p>

        <h3>Users Aged 13 to 17</h3>
        <p>
            Users between the ages of thirteen (13) and seventeen (17) must obtain the <strong>express permission</strong> of a parent or legal guardian to upload photos or submit Personal Information. We reserve the right to request verification of parental consent before processing any orders or images from a minor in this age range.

        <p>
            We will only send promotional and marketing communications to Users who have provided <strong>explicit, separate, and affirmative consent</strong> to receive such messages. This consent is distinct from agreeing to our general Terms and Conditions or completing a transaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Personalized Product Marketing</h3>
        <p>
            If you have provided consent to receive marketing communications, we may use the images you have submitted to create new, personalized digital artwork and product designs (e.g., for new accessories or decorative items). These personalized creations will be sent to you via marketing communications. This process allows us to offer you products that are tailored to your preferences.
        </p>

        <h3>Gift Recipient Handling</h3>
        <p>
            If you provide us with information (e.g., name, address) of a gift recipient, we use that information solely to fulfill the gift order. We do not use the gift recipient's information for marketing purposes unless they independently and separately opt-in to receive communications from us.
        </p>

        <h3>Clear Opt-Out Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>
            All marketing communications will contain a clear, conspicuous, and functional <strong>unsubscribe link</strong>. We will honor all opt-out requests promptly, which will cease all marketing materials, including messages containing personalized product designs.

These agreements mandate that personal and proprietary information be handled in strict confidence and used only for the purpose of performing their contracted duties.
        </p>

        <h3>Access Control</h3>
        <p>
            Access to Personal Information is restricted on a "<strong>need-to-know</strong>" basis to only those personnel who require it to fulfill the service (e.g., the digital artist, the manufacturing liaison, customer service).
