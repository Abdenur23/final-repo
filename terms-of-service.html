        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ownership of Derivative Works:</strong> The Company owns all rights, title, and interest in and to the Derivative Works, including all copyrights and proprietary rights.

        </p>

        <h3>C. Customer's Permitted Use (Limited Personal License):</h3>
        <p>

This license is for the physical object itself and does not grant any rights to the underlying Derivative Work's design or intellectual property.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>License for Digital Elements.</strong><br/>
            We may provide you with certain digital files or renderings of the Derivative Work (the "Digital Elements").

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Strictly Prohibited Uses.</strong><br/>

        <p>
            <strong>Acceptable Returns/Exchanges (Defects Only):</strong> Returns or exchanges are only permitted for products that contain a demonstrable manufacturing defect in materials or workmanship, or verifiable damage incurred before shipment.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Claim Process:</strong> Claims for defects must be submitted to The Company within seven (7) days of the confirmed delivery date. You must provide clear photographic evidence of the defect.

        <h2>10. Terms of Use Addendum: Affiliate Program</h2>
        <p>
            This section governs the terms of participation for individuals or entities enrolled in The Company's Affiliate Program.
        </p>

        <h3>10.1. Agreement to Affiliate Terms & Future Modifications:</h3>
        <p>
            By applying for or participating in our Affiliate Program (the "Program"), or by agreeing to work with us as an affiliate marketer, you (the "Affiliate") agree to be bound by these Affiliate Program Terms. You further acknowledge and agree that We (The Company) reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to restructure, replace, or update these terms. This may include, but is not limited to, publishing a separate, standalone Affiliate Agreement or a completely revised set of program terms on a dedicated legal page. Your continued participation in the Program after any such change is posted constitutes your binding acceptance of the new terms.
        </p>

        <h3>10.2. Independent Contractor Status:</h3>
        <p>
            The Affiliate's relationship with Us is solely that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement will create a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between the Affiliate and The Company. The Affiliate is responsible for all taxes and liabilities associated with their business operations.
        </p>

        <h3>10.3. Program Compliance & Promotional Methods:</h3>
        <p>
            The Affiliate must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Endorsement Guides regarding clear and conspicuous disclosure of the affiliate relationship in all promotional content. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: brand bidding on our trademarks; sending unsolicited emails (spam); employing deceptive or misleading practices; promoting on sites with unlawful, pornographic, or hateful content; and self-referrals (using the link/code for the Affiliate's own purchase).
        </p>

        <h3>10.4. Commissions, Payments & Program Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
            This subsection details the current operational mechanics of the Program and is subject to change as outlined in Section 10.1.
        </p>

        <h4>A. Qualified Sale:</h4>
        <p>
            A "Qualified Sale" is a transaction that meets all of the following criteria: (a) the customer was referred using your unique tracking link or a valid, active promotional code issued to you; (b) the sale is fully paid, not fraudulent, and has not been refunded or returned; (c) the sale is not a self-referral.
        </p>

        <h4>B. Customer Discount & Commission Basis:</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Customer Benefit:</strong> The use of your Affiliate promotional code will automatically apply a fifteen percent (15%) discount to the product subtotal for the customer at checkout. This discount applies only to the product price and explicitly excludes shipping costs, taxes, and handling fees.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Commission Calculation:</strong> Your affiliate commission is calculated based on the "Net Sale Amount." The "Net Sale Amount" is defined as the final product price actually paid by the customer after the application of your promotional code discount, and further excludes all shipping costs, taxes, and handling fees.
        </p>

        <h4>C. Commission Tiers:</h4>
        <p>
            Commissions are paid as a percentage of the Net Sale Amount, based on the total number of Qualified Sales attributed to your promotional code(s) within a calendar month:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Tier 1 (15%):</strong> For fewer than 500 monthly Qualified Sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Tier 2 (17%):</strong> For 500 to 999 monthly Qualified Sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Tier 3 (20%):</strong> For 1,000 or more monthly Qualified Sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> If a customer's product subtotal is $100 and uses your code, they pay $85 for the product (plus shipping/tax). If you are in Tier 1, your commission is 15% of $85 = $12.75.
        </p>

        <h4>D. Program Modifications and Promotional Codes:</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Dynamic Commission Structure:</strong> The Company reserves the right to modify, adjust, or restructure the commission tiers, rates, qualification thresholds, and customer discount percentages at any time and at its sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Notice of Changes:</strong> The Company will provide affiliates with notice of any material changes to these terms via email. Such changes will become effective no less than seven (7) days after the email is sent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Continued Participation:</strong> Your continued participation in the Program after the effective date of the changes constitutes your binding acceptance of the new terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Promotional Code Management:</strong> All promotional codes are subject to activation, expiration dates, and usage caps (e.g., a maximum number of redemptions) as determined by The Company at its sole discretion. The Company is not liable for sales that fail to qualify due to an expired, deactivated, or capped code.
        </p>

        <h4>E. Payment:</h4>
        <p>
            Payouts occur monthly, approximately 45 days after the month's end, subject to a minimum payout threshold of $50.00 USD. We may withhold payment pending investigation of fraudulent activity or disputed sales. You must provide a completed W-9 or W-8BEN form before your first payout.
        </p>

        <h3>10.5. Intellectual Property License:</h3>
        <p>
            We grant the Affiliate a non-exclusive, revocable license to use the trademarks, logos, and marketing materials We provide (the "Licensed Materials") solely for the purpose of promoting our products under this Program. This license terminates immediately upon your termination or removal from the Program.
        </p>

        <h3>10.6. Affiliate Indemnification:</h3>
        <p>
            The Affiliate agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Us, our officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your participation in the Program; (b) your breach of these terms; (c) your use of the Licensed Materials; or (d) your promotional activities, including any claim that your content infringes a third party's rights or violates any law.
        </p>

        <h3>10.7. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability (Affiliate):</h3>
        <p>
            THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS." TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES related to the Program (express or implied) and WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE Affiliate WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL COMMISSIONS PAID TO YOU IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
        </p>

        <h3>10.8. Termination of Affiliate Status:</h3>
        <p>
            Either party may terminate this Affiliate Agreement at any time with written notice. Upon termination, the Affiliate must immediately cease all use of the Licensed Materials and remove all affiliate links and promotional content.
        </p>
